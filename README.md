Leaflet Homework - Visualizing Data with Leaflet

## Introduction

In this project, we create two maps using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.

For the first map, data markers reflects the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and colour. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and darker in colour. It has popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
A legend is also displayed that will provide context for the map data.


For the second map, it has all the elements from the first map plus the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. These latter data is contained in the file - 'PB2002_plates.json' under the 'Leaflet-Step-2/statics' folder. Hence the second map would contain 2 data sets. It also has a number of base maps that allow user to choose from using layer controls that can be turned on and off independently.
